# Bitcoin-utils
A set of utilities functions for Bitcoin.

# What can you do with it
For now, I'm doing the key part.  
You can generate private and public keys, adresses, and in different formats (compressed, uncompressed, WIF).  
You can also use the functions from utils.py if you want to do other things (like base58check encoding, WIF encoding, pseudo-random generation, popular Bitcoin hashing functions).  

# How ?
Just import main.py while it's in development.  

# Examples
